##### Request Body Example:

```
{
  "username": "Your Name",
  "email": "your-email@gmail.com",
  "password": "your-app-password"
}
```

#### 🔐 Using the API with 2FA-Enabled Accounts

We advise that **don't** use your regular **email password**. Instead, on your device navigate into Gmail and click on 'Manage your Google Account'. Locate the Security tab and click on it. Ensure you have enabled 2-step verification and generate an App Password from your email provider. This is what you'd use as your-app-password.

#### 🛠️ What is an App Password?

An App Password is a special password generated from your email provider’s security settings. It allows third-party applications (like this API) to send emails without disabling 2FA.

#### 🔑 How to Generate an App Password

Follow the steps below to create an App Password for Gmail and Outlook.

#### For Gmail Users

```
Go to Google App Passwords.
Select the app ("Mail") and device ("Other (Custom name)").
Click Generate – Google will provide you with a 16-character password.
Use this password instead of your real email password when making API requests.
```

#### For Outlook Users

```
Go to Microsoft Security Settings.
Click Create a new app password.
Copy the password and use it for your API requests.
```

#### A successful authentication response would look like:

```
{
  "details":"Email monitoring started. New inbox mails would receive automated responses.",
  "message":"Login successful."
}
```
